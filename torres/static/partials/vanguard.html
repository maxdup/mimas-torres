      Initially designed as a control point map for competitive play, Vanguard was an attempt at making a map focused around fast paced gameplay. The design of the map allows it to perform nicely in public play as well as in competitive environments. The goal was to make a map that rewards aggressive gameplay and good positioning. The result is a fast paced and punishing map that often results in a great back and forth game between the opposing teams.
